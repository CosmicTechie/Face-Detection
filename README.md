# Face-Detection 

It is a simple program for face detection using Python and OpenCV. As the title suggests, we are going to build a program capable of detecting faces in  a picture, video or a live feed. It can be considered as the very first application of computer vision for a beginner. Face detection is different from Face recognition. Face detection is just about detecting the faces and not more than that but Face recognition is about also recognizing the detected faces, that is to determine whom the face belongs to.

OpenCV provides many pre-trained classifiers that we can use to detect such as faces, eyes,  full body, smile, etc. These are the XML files that we would be using in the project. We will make use of haar cascade classifiers. 

The haarcascades (haarcascade_eye.xml and haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml) are obtained from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/data/haarcascades.
